# FISH
A tool to help new FX traders get insights into their trading journals.

This program synthesizes the recorded strategies in the subsequent Excel Workbook to provide visual insights into the trader's journal.

Specifically, the trader 'checks the box' (marks a 1) for each strategy that they considered when placing a trade.
You then can run the python script, and it will pull the workbook into the script and calculate a ranking for each combination of strategies used over time in the trader's journal.
It gives great insights on the top performers, which strategy is most effective on its own, and more.
