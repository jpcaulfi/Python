# SIGPR

A program I wrote for the U.S. Office of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR).

This program pulls data from a handful of CSV files containing millions of records representing the corporate applications for pandemic relief loans.

The program's primary function is to parse through variances in company names and find duplicates that should not have been awarded extra funding.

It worked with great success!
